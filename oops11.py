print(5+6)
print("5"+"6")

# The plus (+) oparetor here is an example of Polymorphism. When two integers are added wuth + it returns the sum. But when two Ttrings are added it joins them.
# Some other Polymorphism examples:
#     56 + 8 = 64
#        but
#     "56" + "8"= 568

# -, *, /, etc are also polymorphic characters
